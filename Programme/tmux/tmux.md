#### Reloading tmux config
If you have made changes to your tmux configuration file in the ~/.tmux.conf file, it shouldnâ€™t be necessary to start the server up again from scratch with kill-server. Instead, you can prompt the current tmux session to reload the configuration with the source-file command.

This can be done either from within tmux, by pressing Ctrl+B and then : to bring up a command prompt, and typing:

> :source-file ~/.tmux.conf

Or simply from a shell:

> $ tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf

This should apply your changes to the running tmux server without affecting the sessions or windows within them.




#### Autostart Tmux Session On Remote System When Logging In Via SSH
To autostart Tmux session when connecting via SSH, edit your remote system's ~/.bash_profile file:

> $ nano ~/.bash_profile

If the file is not available, just create it.

And add the following lines in it:
```
if [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
    tmux attach -t default || tmux new -s default
fi
```

Save and close the file. Log out and log back into the remote systems. You will be landed into a new Tmux session named ___default___.
