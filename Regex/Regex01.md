Let's start with a simple task to help orient you to patterns.

Note: The regular expression must be written in the Perl dialect (basically the same as PCRE in regex101.com).

Note: You can use the regex101 website to test your regex patterns. This link will bring you to a page that contains the strings to test on as well.


1. Write a regex pattern that matches and skips the specified words listed below.

    Match: can; fan; Man
    Skip: ran; tan; lan

Answer: `([a-bc-gmH-M]an)`

2. Let's get down to business and start helping Klaus out.

The first task is to write a regular expression pattern to validate a person's birth date. Let's set some requirements for the format:

    The date should be in the following format:
        DD/MM/YYYY --- Day/Month/Year with leading zeros (07/02/2009)
    To simplify the task, let's assume that there are 31 days in every month and the year is 1000 and 2999.

Answer: `([0][1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|[3][0-1])/([0][1-9]|[1][0-2])/([1-2][0-99]{3})$`
  `(([0][1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|[3][0-1])[/]([0][1-9]|[1][0-2])[/]([1-2][0-99]{3}))(\W)`

3. Your next exercise is to write a pattern that matches a person's full name. Again, let's set some requirements:

    The full name consists of the first name and the last name, separated by a space.
    The first name consists of at least two Latin alphabet letters (a to z) and starts with a capital letter.
    A person can have two first names, separated with either a  (space) or a - (hyphen) character.
    The last name consists of one or more Latin alphabet letters (a to z) and starts with a capital letter.

Answer: `(((^[A-Z][a-z]+)|(^[A-Z][a-z]+) ([A-Z][a-z]+))|(^[A-Z][a-z]+)-([A-Z][a-z]+)) ([A-Z][a-z]*)$`


4. Match an email


To practice the regex basics you've learned so far, try to write a regex pattern that matches an email address. For the purposes of this exercise, let's define an email address as containing these elements: <local-part>@<domain>.<top-level-domain> where:

    The local-part contains at least one character, which may be one of the following:
        Uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;
        Digits 0 to 9;
        Other characters !#%&_-;
        The . (dot) character, provided that it is not the first or last character.
    The domain contains at least one character, which may be one of the following:
        Uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;
        Digits 0 to 9;
        The - (hyphen) character, provided that it is not the first or last character.
    The top-level-domain from two to six characters in length ,and may contain the following:
        lowercase Latin letters a to z.
