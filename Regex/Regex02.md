Let's start with a warm up task. Find all palindromes of length 2 to 7 (case insensitive) in a string. The palindrome can contain only word characters.

    Write a regex pattern that matches a palindrome.

NOTE! The regular expression must be written in the Perl dialect (basically the same as PCRE in regex101.com).

NOTE! You can use the regex101 website to test your regex patterns (The link contains the strings to test on as well).

Match a hostname


Let's start off by writing a regex pattern for probably the most important part of a URL - the hostname (<domain>.<top-level-domain>).

Here are some requirements for the format of the hostname:

    The domain contains one or more labels concatenated with . (dot) characters.
    The label contains at least one character that may be one of the following:
        uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;
        digits 0 to 9;
        % (percent sign) character;
        _ (underscore) or -(hyphen) characters provided that they are not in the first or the last position.
    The top-level-domain consists of 2 to 6 lowercase Latin letters a to z.

    Write a regex pattern to match a hostname.

Match a basic URL


Now that you got the most important part of the URL covered, you can form a basic URL simply by adding a protocol (http/https/ftp) and a path like this:

<protocol>://<hostname>[<path>] (The parts in square brackets don't have to occur in a valid URL)

Here are some requirements for the format of the path:

    It starts with a / (forward slash) character;
    After the starting / (forward slash) character comes 0 or more parts in the same format as the label in the previous step. Those parts are concatenated with / (forward slash) characters;
    It may have a / (forward slash) character, a .<file-extension> or nothing in the end;
    The file-extension consists of 1 to 20 lowercase Latin letters a to z.

    Write a regex pattern to match a basic URL.

Improve your regex


The next step is to improve the pattern by making it a bit more flexible. A URL can also contain a query string and a hash.

The improved URL is in the following format: <protocol>://<hostname>[<path>][?<query>][#<hash>], where:

    The query contains 0 or more characters which may be one of the following:
        uppercase and lowercase Latin letters A to Z and a to z;
        digits 0 to 9;
        characters _%=&-.
    The hash is in the same format as the query.

Make the substitution


Now that you have a pretty solid regex pattern for validating a URL, let's move on and write a substitution pattern to change all valid URLs in a text to the following format:

`<a href="URL">hostname</a>`

    Wrap all the URLs into an HTML a tag.
